# 🧠 SpeechIQ – Real-Time Speech Intent Recognition

**SpeechIQ** is a real-time Speech Intent Recognition system that uses **Wave2Vec2** for speech-to-text transcription and a lightweight text classification model to determine the user’s intent from spoken audio.

---

## 🎯 What Does SpeechIQ Do?

1. Accepts a `.wav` voice recording from the user.
2. Transcribes the speech using **Wave2Vec2** (self-supervised ASR model from Facebook AI).
3. Classifies the transcribed sentence into one of the **predefined intents**.
4. Returns the **transcription** and **predicted intent** via a clean REST API.

## 🧠 Why Wave2Vec2 Over MFCC?

| Criteria             | MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) | Wave2Vec2                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Feature Extraction   | Hand-crafted                                | Self-learned (deep contextual learning)   |
| Preprocessing Needed | High (windowing, DCT, etc.)                 | Minimal (raw waveform input)              |
| Noise Robustness     | Low                                         | High                                      |
| Performance          | Good for classical ASR                      | Superior in modern NLP/ASR tasks          |
| Deep Contextual Info | No                                          | Yes (uses transformers)                   |

**Wave2Vec2** eliminates the dependency on MFCC by learning representations directly from raw waveform inputs. This enables better transcription, especially in noisy or varied environments, and greatly enhances the accuracy of downstream intent classification tasks.
